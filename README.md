# Advanced Computer Architecture Project

## Title
**Performance Analysis and Optimization of a Multithreaded Application Using Intel VTune**

## Overview
This project explores the performance characteristics of a multithreaded application using Intel VTune Profiler. It aims to identify performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations to enhance overall execution efficiency.

The project was developed as part of the curriculum for the Advanced Computer Architecture course.

## Objectives
- Profile a multithreaded application using Intel VTune.
- Analyze performance metrics such as CPU utilization, thread concurrency, memory usage, and hotspots.
- Identify bottlenecks including thread contention, cache misses, and load imbalance.
- Apply appropriate code-level and system-level optimizations.
- Compare performance before and after optimization.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Intel VTune Profiler**: For in-depth performance analysis.
- **C/C++**: Programming language used to develop the multithreaded application.
- **POSIX Threads (pthreads)**: For implementing multithreading.
- **Linux Environment**: Target platform for building and testing.
